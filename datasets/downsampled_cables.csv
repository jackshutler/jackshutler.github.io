6. NOTEWORTHY RESULTS: EASTMAN KODAK SOLD ALL DISPLAY
ITEMS FROM FLOOR AND STATED QUOTE THIS COMBINED EXHIBITION
SYMPHOSIUM THOUGH SMALL IN SIZE, WAS WITHOUT DOUBT BIG IN
STATURE.  THIS PROVED BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
ATTENDED AND THEIR SERIOUS ATTENTION PARTICULARLY DURING

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WHOLE VENTURE COULD NOT BE FAULTED
IN ANY WAY.  UNQUOTE (CLEARED FOR PUBLICATION) SCM

OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GOOD CONTACTS FOR FUTURE BUSINESS.
THE DEPARTMENT DESERVES HIGH MARKS INDEED FOR ITS SUCESS
IN GETTING THE RELEVANT PEOPLE IN AND FOR THE QUALITY OF
THE SHO.  UNQUOTE (CLEARED FOR PUBLICATION)
7. OBSERVATIONS: OBVIOUSLY, SUPPORT OF THE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY AND STATE COMMITTEE FOR SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF SEMINAR/EXHIBIT.  AS
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RE PREPARATION FOR THIS JEEP, MANY HOURS
WERE SPENT IN NAILING DOWN SPONSORSHIP.  ONCE STATE COMMITTEE
OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREED TO SPONSOR AND CHAMBER
AGREED DISTRIBUTE TICKETS, AUDIENCE SHOWED UP IN MASSE.
PRODUCT THEME WAS A GOOD ONE.  BOTH IBM AND SCM REPORTED
EXCELLENT INTEREST IN COPYING MACHINES.  ALTHOUGH SCM FOUND
ONLY LIMITED INTEREST IN SMALL MACHINES USING 2 MC. OXIDE
PAPER BUT MUCH GREATER INTEREST IN LARGE (ALONG LINES OF
XEROX 3600) MACHINE WHICH WORKS ON PLAIN PAPER.  KODAK
SOLD THEIR MICROFILM EQUIPMENT EASILY.  ADVANCE PROCESS
SUPPLY SPEND LONG HOURS IN PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS WITH
IMPORTANT PUBLISHING INSTITUTES.  DEPENDING ON USDOC'S
DECISION FOR INTERORGTECHNIKA 75, THESE FIRMS SHOULD

G. NUMBER OF EXHIBITORS WITH REPRESENTATIVES
ATTENDING FROM U.S.: 3 AMERICANS FROM 2 COMPANIES.
NOTE: IBM HAD RESIDENT AMERICAN DIRECTOR
KODAK SENT 3 FROM U.K.
9. EXHIBITORS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH ALL FACETS OF THIS
SEMINAR/EXHIBITION.  WE HOPE TO OBTAIN BSPS FROM ALL FOUR
DURING NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  LAST MINUTE DROP-OUT BY
IMAGE SYSTEMS CAUSED SOME EMBARRASSMENT, BUT DID PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL EXHIBIT SPACE IN AN ALREADY CROWDED AREA.
EQUIPMENT CONTENT AND SIZE WELL SUITED TO MIRO SYSTEM AND
AVAILABLE SPACE.  SUGGEST USDOC FURNISH COPIES OF BRIEFING
MATERIALS AS USED TYPE I TRADE FAIRS TO EXHIBITORS
BEFORE THEY DEPART FOR THE SOVIET UNION.  IF USDOC SUPPLY
EXHAUSTED, USCOMOFF CAN FORWARD ADDITIONAL MATERIALS.
EMBASSY WILL FORWARD THESE ITEMS TO USEWTC PRIOR TO
CHROMA/SPECTRO JEEP IN DECEMBER.
10. WITHOUT SUPPORT OF SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE/INDUSTRY, SUCCESS OF THIS SHOW WOULD
HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATICAL, AT BEST.  COMPAISON OF OUR
EXPERIENCE IN JULY AND LATEST CASE IS QUITE INSTRUCTIVE.
COMMOFF BELIEVES THIS POINTS UP, INTER ALIA, NECESSITY OF
ADHERING AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO CHAMBER'S REQUEST THAT
INFORMATION ON PROPOSED JEEPS/SEMINARS BE PRESENTED NO
LATER THAN SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO EVENT IN QUESTION.  AS THIS
DEADLINE HAS ALREADY PASSED FOR MARCH 1975 OIL/GAS FIELD
EQUIPMENT JEEP, WE WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING INFORMATION
ON THIS EVENT, EVEN IF INCOMPLETE, ASAP.

BUILT UNDER THE SALT AGREEMENT, AND WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF

ANY VIOLATION OF THAT AGREEMENT.
7.Q: ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE HOLES OR WHATEVER IS BEING
CONSTRUCTED ARE NOT MISSILE SILOS, IS THAT CORRECT?
8.A: THAT'S A FAIR INFERENCE.
9.Q: ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY ARE CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING
UNDERGROUND WHICH CAN BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN SILOS?

10. A: THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INDICATIONS THAT THE SOVIETS
ARE BUILDING SOME COMMAND AND CONTROL FACILITIES IN THEIR
SILO FIELDS.  THEY'VE HAD COMMAND AND CONTROL FACILITIES
BEFORE, AS OBVIOUSLY YOU'D ALWAYS HAVE COMMAND AND
CONTROL ASSOCIATED WITH MISSILE FIRING.  THIS IS NOT
REALLY NEW, IT HAS BEEN IN THE PRESS FOR AT LEAST A
COUPLE OF YEARS.
11. Q: DOES ONE OF THOSE THINGS LOOK LIKE A MISSILE SILO?
THE LAST TIME I WAS IN A MINUTEMAN COMMAND AND CONTROL
CENTER, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A SILO.
12. A: THE SOVIETS DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW OUR ARCHITECTUAL
STYLES.
13. Q: WHAT STYLE THEY DO USE IS WHAT I'M ASKING.
14. A: I DON'T WHAT TO GO INTO SPECIFICS ON THAT TODAY.
15. Q: WE'RE LEFT WITH GENERAL BROWN SAYING CATEGORICALLY
THE SOVIETS HAVE NOT VIOLATED THE SALT AGREEMENT.  WE ASK

YOU ABOUT REPORTS THAT THEY'RE BUILDING UP TO 200 NEW
SILOS AND YOU SAY ""NO COMMENT.""  YOU SAY THERE ARE
SUBLIMITS TO THE TYPES OF SILOS THAT CAN BE BUILT.  I'M
SURE THAT 200 WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE TREATY.
16. A: I THINK I'VE GONE BEYOND THAT NOW IN THE MORE
RECENT DISCUSSION IN SAYING THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME
CONSTRUCTION OF COMMAND AND CONTROL FACILITIES IN THE
MISSILE FIELDS.
17. Q: I BELIEVE THE SALT AGREEMENT SET UP A CONSULTATIVE
COMMITTEE TO DEAL WITH JUST THIS KIND OF QUESTION.  HAS
THIS BEEN RAISED WITH THE SOVIET UNION?
18. A: I DO NOT CARE TO GO INTO WHAT HAS OR HASN'T BEEN
DISCUSSED IN THE STANDING CONSULTATIVE COMMISSION.  I
DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO DO SO.   INGERSOLL

REJECTED PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM AUSTRALIA OR ON THE WHARF
IN THE US.

RATHER CONTENTIOUS.

E.O. 11652: N/A
TAGS: ILO AORG
SUBJECT: ILO: 194TH GOVERNING BODY: REQUEST FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON
FINANCIAL QUESTIONS

1. TWO PAPERS FOR BUILDING SUBCOMMITTEE HAVING FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS
WERE SPRUNG ON DELEGATES ON ARRIVAL IN GENEVA. PAPERS ARE NUMBERED
GB.194/PFA/BS/1/1: NEW HEADQUARTERS BUILDING: PROGRESS REPORT AND
FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE PROJECT--PROGRESS REPORT, AND GB.194/PFA/
BS/1/2: NEW HEADQUARTERS,ETC.--LOAN ANNUITY AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR
FINANCING THE EXPECTED COST OVERRUN ON THE BUILDING. BOTH DATED
OCTOBER 25 AND MAY HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN IO/LABW BY THIS TIME.

2. BS/1/1 STATES THAT TOTAL COST OF NEW BUILDING HAS RISEN FROM
APRIL 30, 1974, ESTIMATE OF SWISS FRANCS 137,751,290 TO SEPTEMBER 30,
1974, ESTIMATE OF 143,520,000 FRANCS. TOTAL AVAILABLE RESOURCES,
INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF PETIT SACONNEX ANNEX, AMOUNT TO
140,600,000 FRANCS.

3. PAPER BS/1/2 STATES THAT FUNDS PRESENTLY ALLOCATED IN 1974-75
BUDGET FOR BUILDING WILL NOT RPT NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR PAYING
CONTRACTORS BILLS FALLING DUE IN 1975. SOME OF THESE BILLS
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  GENEVA 06731  051631Z

WILL BE FOR EXTRA WORK CONTRACTED FOR SO THAT MOVE INTO NEW
BUILDING CAN BE SUFFICIENTLY ACCOMPLISHED TO ENABLE GOVERNING
BODY TO MEET THERE IN FEBRUARY 1975. THERE ARE ALSO SOME THREE
MILLION FRANCS IN BILLS THAT OFFICE IS PROTESTING AND THAT
POSSIBLY WILL GO TO ARBITRATION. OFFICE MUST BE PREPARED FOR
DECISION AWARDING PART OR ALL OF CONTESTED OVERRUNS TO CONTRACTORS.

4. TO PROVIDE CASH NEEDED FOR PAYMENT OF 1975 BILLS, AND TO
PROVIDE READILY ACCESSIBLE FUNDS FOR FUTURE ALTERATIONS, REPAIS,
AND MAINTENANCE, DIRECTOR GENERAL PROPOSES FOLLOWING MEASURES;
  A. ANNUAL PAYMENTS OF THE 40 YEAR FIPOI MORTAGE ARE SET AT
5,652,400 FRANCS. FIPOI INFORMALLY AGREES TO ACCEPT THE FIRST
PAYMENY (1975) AN AMOUNT OF THREE MILLION FRANCS, WITH REMAINING
2,652,400 BEING SPREAD EQUALLY OVER REMAINING THIRTY-NINE PAY-
MENTS. DIRECTOR GENERAL PROPOSES TO TRANSFER THE 2,652,400 FRANCS,
ALREADY PROVIDED IN 1975-75 BUDGET, TO BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION
FUND.
  B. NET RECEIPTS FROM RENTALS IN FUTURE WILL BE PAID TO
BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION FUND. SOURCES WILL BE RENT FROM
CONCESSIONAIRS (BANK,BOOK, STALL, TRAVEL AGENCY, FOOD SERVICES)
AND OTHER AGENCIES RENTING OFFICE SPACE IN NEW BUILDING. (THERE
IS NO RPT NO DECISION YET ON PRINCIPLE OF PARKING FEE, OR WHERE
MONEY WOULD GO IF FEE CHARGED.)
  C. PROGRAM, FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE (PFA) WILL
BE ASKED (SEE DOCUMENT GB. 194/PFA/13/19, PARAS 7 AND 12) TO
AUTHORIZE DIRECTOR GENERAL TO DRAW ON BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION
FUND TO MEET SUCH EXPENDITURES AS MAY BE NECESSARY ABOVE THE
140,600,000 FRANCS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO JOHN
RICHES, ILO BUILDING COORDINATOR, THESE ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE USED
TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS IN 1975, AND TO ENABLE DIRECTOR
GENERAL TO CARRY OUT FUTURE ALTERNATIONS, REPAIRS AND MAINTENCE.

5. USDEL AND SOVDEL PROTESTED LATE PRESENTATION OF DOCUMENTS,
AND STATED THEY WERE UNABLE TO TAKE ANY POSITION ON DIRECTOR
GENERAL'S REQUESTS UNTIL THEY HAD INSTURCTIONS, WHICH THEY WOULD
SEEK ASAP. CHAIRMAN (MORGAN, UK) AGREED THAT SUBCOMMITTEE COULD
BE RECONVENED WHEN USDEL AND SOVDEL HAVE INSTRUCTIONS. PRESUME
THIS WILL HAVE TO BE BY MONDAY, NOV 11 AT LATES, SINCE PLENARY
SESSIONS START NOV 12.

6. USDEL SEES SOME MERIT IN SUPPORTING ALL PROPOSALS, SINCE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03  GENEVA 06731  051631Z

THEY WOULD HAVE EFFECT OF REDUCING CLAIRMS OF NEW BUILDING
AGAINST ASSESSMENT BUDGET, WHICH ARE GOING TO BE EMBARRASSINGLY
LARGE AT BEST. ALSO, IN CASE OF GENUINE EMERGENCY, PROPOSED
ARRANGEMENTS WOULD GIVE DIRECTOR GENERAL MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY
IN ACTING EXPEDITIOUSLY TO CONTRACT FOR REPAIRS. USDEL NOT
INCLINED RECOMMEND SUPPORT, HOWEVER FOR FOLLOWING REASONS:
  A. WITH PROPOSAL TO DIVERT ONE-HALF OF NET RECEIPTS FROM
PUBLICATION SALES AWAY FROM WORKING CAPITAL FUND (WCF), WHICH
PROBABLY WILL BE APPROVED, PROPOSED DIVERSION OF RENTALS THAT
WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO WCF, COULD RESULT IN LOWING OF WCF
TO POINT OF REQUIRING A REPLENISHMENT ASSESSMENT ON ILO MEMBERS.
  B. DIRECTOR GENERAL WILL ACQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL SUMS (RENTAL
RECEIPTS ESTIMATED AT 490,000 FRANCS A YEAR) WHICH HE CAN USE
WITHOUT GOVERNING BODY APPROVAL.

7 . USDEL REQUESTS INSTRUCTIONS ONFOLLOWING POINTS:
A. PRPOSAL TO DIVERT 2,652,400 FRANCS FROM FIRST (1975)
MORTAGE PAYMENT INTO BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATION FUND, FOR
PURPOSE OF PAYING 1975 BUILDING BILLS.
  B. PROPOSAL TO ADD 2,652,400 FRANCS TO THE 39 MORTAGE PAYMENTS
STARTING 1976 (WITH CONSEQUENT INCREASE IN TOTAL INTEREST
PAYMENTS OVER LIFE OF LOAN AT 3 1/2 PERCENT).
  C. PROPOSAL THAT FUTURE RETNTALS BE PAID INTO BUILDING AND
ACCOMMODATION FUND, INSTEAD OF INTO WCF.
  D. PROPOSAL TO GIVE DIRECTOR GENERAL AUTHORITY TO USE
BUILDING AND ACCOMMODATIN FUND FOR PAYMENT OF COSTS OF
INTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND FOR FUTURE ALTERATIONS, REPAIRS, AND
MAINTENANCE, ON BASIS OF REPORTING TO GOVERNING BODY AFTER THE
FACT, RATHER THAN SEEKING PERMISSION FROM GOVERNING BODY IN
ADVANCE.DALE

THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND I AM SATISFIED THAT NO ONE IN
THIS MISSION EVER TALKED TO A REPRESENTATIVE OF BEAR MOUNTAIN
OR MADE ANY SUCH OUTLANDISH STATEMENT.  I DEPLORE BEAR MOUN-
TAIN'S ACCUSATION TO ITS CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE ON THE
BASIS OF SUCH FABRICATED EVIDENCE.

2. SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF WINE AND CHAMPAGNE SOLD IN OUR
EMBASSY COMMISSARY ARE OF U.S. ORIGIN.  NOT ONLY I, BUT ALSO
MY OFFICERS, REGULARLY SERVE CALIFORNIA TABLE WINES.

3. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS MATTER SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO
THE ATTENTION OF CONGRESSMAN KETCHUM AND THAT IN THE FUTURE
ACCUSATIONS SUCH AS THIS SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE.

1.  DURING SEPTEMBER 20 MEEING WITH U.S. TOURISM DELEGATION,
DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF STATE COMMITTEE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
G.M. GVISHIANI TOOK GREAT PRIDE IN FACT THAT HE HAD TWO
SONY VIDEOTAPE RECORDER (VTR) SYSTEMS IN HIS OFFICE.  COMMATT,
WHO ACCOMPANIED U.S. DELEGATION, NOTED THAT GVISHIANI HAD
SEVERAL VTR CASSETTES FROM FOREIGN COMPANIES, INCLUDING
COCA-COLA, BASF AND BAYER, AND MENTIONED TO GVISHIANI THAT
VTR CASSETTES OPENED INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES FOR CONTACTS
BETWEEN SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS AND U.S. FIRMS.  GVISHIANI AGREED
AND SAID HE RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF CASSETTES FOR U.S.
COMPANIES.

2.  COMMENT:  IN VIRE CONTINUING EFFORTS BY U.S. COMPANIES TO
ATTRACT GVISHIANI'S ATTENTION, WHICH IS NOT EASY GIVEN HIS MANY
COMMITMENTS, STATE AND COMMERCE MIGHT WISH TO SUGGEST TO FIRMS
WHICH HAVE VTR CASSETTES ON COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES THAT THEY
CONSIDER SENDING CASSETTES TO GVISHIANI.  ONE INTERESTING
SIDELIGHT IS THAT SOVIETS ARE APPARENTLY ATTEMPTING TO COPY
SONY VTR, ALBEIT ON RATHER MODES SCAL.  GVISHIANI POINTED
OUT SMALL, UNIMPRESSIVE INSTRUMENT WHICH WAS PLACED
ON TABLE NEXT TO SONY SYSTEMS AND SAID, RATHER SCORNFULLY,
THAT THIS WAS ""OUR INDUSTRY'S ATTEMPT TO MATCH SONY.""

WITH FIRST DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER KUZNETSOV) IS ALSO A
POSSIBILITY.  IF SENATOR HAS CHANGES TO SUGGEST, WE RECOMMEND
THAT DEPARTMENT CABLE THEM TO US IMMEDIATE.  IDEALLY THEY

IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW BEFORE HOLIDAY PERIOD BEGINS

4.  U.S. EXCHANGE STUDENTS VERY EAGER TO MEET SENATOR.  WE

1.  AT NOVEMBER 5TH MEETING WITH GOSK DEPUTY-DIRECTOR
MYASOYEDOV, EMBOFF AGAIN ADVOCATED PERFORMANCES IN
VILNIUS ON DECEMBER 7TH AS WELL AS CHANGING MOSCOW
PREMIERE TO DECEMBER 10.TH.  MYASOYEDOV CORDIALLY, BUT
FIRMLY DECLINED BOTH PROPOSALS, EXPLAINING THAT MATTER HAD
BEEN TAKEN TO DEPUTY-MINISTER-OF-CULTURE LEVEL IN ORDER
OBTAIN VILINIUS AS FOURTH PERFORMANCE SITE, AND THAT IT WAS ONLY
WITH GRET DIFFICULTY THAT VILNIUS THEATER WAS MADE AVAILABLE
AT ALL AT SUCH LATE DATE.  WHEN IT CAME TO MYASOYEDOV'S
ATTENTION YESTERDAY THAT JOFFREY AGAIN DEMANDED FOURRTH
DAY IN VILNIUS, HE INQUIRED THROUGH HIS CHANNELS TO ATTEMPT
ARRANGE TWO PERFORMANCES ON SEVENTH, BUT WAS TOLD THAT
THEATER RESERVED FOR VILNIUS COMPANY ITSELF BEGINNING THE
SEVENTH.  MYASOYEDOV ADDED THAT IT WAS VILNIUS COMPANY
THAT WAS DISLODGED BY JOFFREY'S QUOTE LAST-MINUTE
INSISTENCE ON FOURTH CITY ENDQUOTE.

2.  RE JOFFREY POINT THAT FIVE RATHER THAN FOUR

3.  MYASOYEDOV UNABLE POSTPONE MOSCOW PREMIERE UNTIL
DECEMBER 10TH, POINTING OUT THAT SINCE THERE CAN BE NO
PERFORMANCES IN VILNIUS ON THE SEVENTH, THE REQUISITE
PERIOD FOR TRAVEL AND REST, AS STATED IN THE CONTRACT, IS
PROVIDED FOR IF THE PREMIERE REMAINS THE NINTH.  EMBASSY
REITERATES THAT THERE HAS NEVER RPT NEVER BEEN ANY DISCUSSION
OF WHICH DAYS OF WEEK ARE TO BE SCHEDULED AS FREE AND
TRAVEL DAYS, AND THAT IF CRAWFORD HAD MEANT TO DESIGNATE
SPECIFIC DAYS, I.E. MONDAY AND TUESDAY, HE SHOULD HAVE
DONE SO BEFORE CONTRACT WAS SIGNED.  AS FOR MOSCOW THEATER'S
AVAILABILITY TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PREMIERE (STATE 241128,
PARA 2), STATE 016046 SPECIFIES TWO FULL DAYS FOR REHEARSALS
IN LENINGRAD ONLY.  GOSK SAYS THEATER WILL BE AVAILABLE

ENDQUOTE ARRANGE TWO PERFORMANCES ON SIXTEENTH AND ONE ON
SEVENTHEENTH DECEMBER IF JOFFREY WISHES EXTEND MOSCOW APPEAR-
ANCE, BUTEMBASSY MUST KNOW ASAP IF COMPANY CAN REMAIN
THREE EXTRA DAYS.  EMBASSY SUPPORTS PROPOSAL FOR THREE
EXTRA PERFORMANCES IN MOSCOW.  (EMBASSY ALSO WISHES POINT
OUT THAT PROPOSED SCHEDULE FOR SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH
APPEARS TO CONTRADICT CRAWFORD'S INSISTENCE ON STRICT
ADHERENCE TO THE MONDAY-TUESDAY RULE AND THEREBY WEAKENS
HIS ARGUMENT FOR CHANGING PREMIERE TO TENTH.)

5. GOSK'S SCHEDULE NOW STANDS:  PREMIERE IN MOSCOW
DECEMBER 9TH; EVENING PERFORMANCE 10TH; EVENING PERFORMANCE
11TH; EVENING PERFORMANCE 12TH; AMBASSADOR'S RECEPTION

EVENING PERFORMANCE 17TH, THE 15TH BEING A FREE DAY.  AT

COULD BE CONSIDERED REHEARSAL DAY ONLY, IN LIGHT OF IMPORTANCE
TO COMPANY MOSCOW PREMIERE AND IN LIGHT OF COMPANY'S OFFER
TO EXTEND FOR THREE EXTRA PERFORMANCES.  GOSK ANSWERED THAT

6.  FYI: IT IS MYASOYEDOV'S OPINION, STATED IN EMBOFF'S
PRESENCE, THAT FOR REASONS OF THEIR OWN, JOFFREY""
CRAWFOR ARE TRYING TO POSE OBSTACLES TO TOUR AND
FORCE CANCELLATION.  FOR DEPUTY-DIRECTOR TO HOLD
SUCH OPINION PLACES EMBASSY IN DIFFICULT POSITION REGARD-
ING FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS FOR AMERICAN GROUPS.  POINTED
REMARK FOLLOWED THAT HUROK ASSOCIATES ARE SO MUCH EASIER
TO DEAL WITH, AND EMBASSY FEARS IT BECOMING CLOSELY
IDENTIFIED WITH JOFFREY COMPANY'S LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM
IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS.  ENDY FYI.

7.  WISH TO REMIND DEPARTMENT THAT SOVIET HOLIDAYS
